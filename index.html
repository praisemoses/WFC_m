                Guns aren't killing people, people are killing people. 
                You can buy a guy pretty much anywhere and go somewhere and shoot. 
                A lot of the times it's the shootings at schools and police brutality that make the news. 
                what about other places where gun violence takes place?
                <br>
                <br> 
                Gun violence is a issue specific to America that affects lots of people every year.

                    Violence isn't inevitable, there are ways to prevent it. 
                    We just have to agree that it needs to end.
                    Some states have already implemeted laws for gun safety, but a lot of other states aren't there yet.

                <p>
                    All in all we need to strengthen federal and state laws when it come to guns. 
                    For those who don't think gun violence is a problem, you are a part of it.
